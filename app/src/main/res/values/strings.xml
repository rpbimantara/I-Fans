        LBE HONEST AND TRUE\n\n\n\n
          BY GEORGE BIRDSEYE\n\n\n\n
Be honest and true, boys!\n\n
Whatever you do, boys,\n\n
Let this be your motto through life.\n\n
Both now and forever,\n\n
Be this your endeavor,\n\n
When wrong with the right is at strife.\n\n
The best and the truest,\n\n
Alas! are the fewest;\n\n
But be one of these if you can.\n\n
In duty ne’er fail; you\n\n
Will find ’twill avail you,\n\n
And bring its reward when a man.\n\n
Don’t think life plain sailing;\n\n
There’s danger of failing,\n\n
Though bright seem the future to be;\n\n
But honor and labor,\n\n
And truth to your neighbor,\n\n
Will bear you safe over life’s sea.\n\n
Then up and be doing,\n\n
Right only pursuing,\n\n
And take your fair part in the strife.\n\n
Be honest and true, boys,\n\n
Whatever you do, boys,\n\n
Let this be your motto through life!\n\n</string>
